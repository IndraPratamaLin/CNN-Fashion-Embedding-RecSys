# CNN Fashion Embedding for Recommendation System

Hi welcome, in this notebook we will use embeddings and Transfer Learning to identify similar items, then use this information to recommend similar content in Recommendation System.

We have three options to make a model:
* ResNet50
* Xception
* Efficient-Net (i used Efficent-net B3 here)

I already trained & saved this model to csv format, so we can load and using it without training (similar to transfer learning). You can [download the dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/indralin/fashion-embedding-weights-in-csv)

You also can look this notebook in [my kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/indralin/cnn-fashion-embedding-for-recommendation-system)

I hope you can enjoy this notebook, thanks a lot.
